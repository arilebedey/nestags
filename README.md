This repository is a showcase of a project I started to help me add a "nested tags" functionality to my bookmarks database.⠀

⠀

The idea of "nested tags" came to me after being frustrated with the usual one dimensional list of tags and simple nested folders used to categorize bookmarks in the majority of bookmarkng software.

I realized that I wanted to be able to have "parent" tags and "child" tags. And here's an example of how I wanted it to work:
⠀

⠀

Let's say I have a song that I would like to bookmark..

This song is a Rock song and I like to listen to it when I wake up..
This means that this song will have a "Waking up" and a "Rock" tag. Now this feature is available in many bookmarking software, but the tags themselves usually cannot have their own tags which greatly increases the number of tags I would have to create in order to add precise tags to my bookmarks.

Which the help of this CLI application my song could have a "Rock" tag that would itself (the tag) have a tag (of its own), "Music genre", and logically the tag "Waking up" would have a tag of "Music for..."..

And that way each specific tag would be "nested" into a parent tag which would create a pleasing tree of tags and their "parents" which are easily viewed and used to filter and search for lists bookamrks (for example songs) with specific those tags.
