This repository is a showcase of a project I started to help me add a "nested tags" functionality to my bookmarks database.⠀

⠀

The idea of "nested tags" came to me after being frustrated with the usual one dimensional list of tags and simple nested folders used to categorize bookmarks in the majority of bookmarkng software.

I realized that I wanted to be able to have "parent" tags and "child" tags. And here's an example of how I wanted it to work:
⠀

⠀

Let's say I have a song that I would like to bookmark..

This song is a Rock song and I like to listen to it when I wake up..
This means that this song will have a "Waking up" and a "Rock" tag. Now this feature is available in many bookmarking software, but the tags themselves usually cannot have their own tags which greatly increases trouble I would be in when looking at all by tags.

But with the help of this CLI application my song's "Rock" tag would itself be capable of having its own tag of "Music genre", and logically the tag "Waking up" would itself have a tag of "Music for..."..

And that way each specific tag would be "nested" into a parent tag which would create a pleasing tree of tags and their "parents" which are easily viewed and used to filter and search for lists bookamrks (for example songs) with specific those tags.
⠀

⠀

This back-end application features are:
- Adding a tag
- Attributing tag to parent tag
- Adding parent tags
- Fetching all tags from specific parents tags
- Sorting entries by combination of tags

Status of the project: unfinished.
Reason: Programming became more important that previously important music aspirations.
